 # What is aYo? 

    aYo is an application to improve a programmer's efficiency by providing voice-command quick access to programming language
    documentation and other online web-searching. The purpose is to help quickly answer questions mid development without
    interrupting the flow of thought. Additionally, aYo provides fast and easy access to learning materials and the official
    documentation of various languages in addition to common voice assistant functionality, like playing music. aYo is designed 
    to take advantage of Microsoft's Cognitive Services for seamless implementation. What sets aYo apart from its competition 
    will be its focus on aiding Software Developers; unlike Alexa, Cortana, Google Assistant and Siri which were designed for 
    more general purposes.   

 # Who is aYo designed for?   

    In general, aYo is designed to be a helpful assistant to anyone who downloads it. However, its focus is on software 
    developers and as such many of its unique features are focused on enhancing the software development process. With language 
    documentation, music, program execution, and real time query searching over the internet, aYo is made to be a tool that 
    empowers software developers during the development process allowing them to complete their work in a more efficient manner 
    while still providing the basic tools most voice assistants have.  

 # Compatibility: 

    Windows 
 
 # Installation  

   # Language: Python 

        aYo is designed to run in Python version 3.9.2 

        To download the latest version of Python go to this website: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

        You can check your current version of python with the:   python3 --version   command in your console/terminal. 

   # Python packages to download and the version aYo uses:  

        Downloading a specific package in python can be done though these simple steps:  

         1) Open a Console/Terminal window and make sure you are currently in the root file directory.  

         2) type pip3 install "insert package name here". An example of the command to install playsound is shown below: 

            pip3 install playsound 

         3) Wait. It usually takes a few seconds to fetch the package and begin installing.  

         4) Once it is done installing, check that it was successful by typing pip3 list into your terminal. 
         After hitting enter, this will show a list of all the python packages you have downloaded and their version number.  

        Here is the list of packages aYo needs to function.  

        Package Name                         Version 
        ----------------------------------   -------       
        azure-cognitiveservices-speech       1.16.0 
        playsound                            1.2.2 
        PyQt5_sip                            12.8.1 
        PyYAML                               5.4.1 
        requests                             2.25.1 
        spotipy                              2.18.0 
        word2number                          1.1 


        If you need to check your packages, the     pip3 list      command will show you 
        the name and version number of all the python packages you have downloaded.
